                    a supermarket and grocery. People in food deserts can afford food but cannot afford healthier food options. This can include fruits and vegetables. Instead, People in a food desert have to choose cheaper but unhealthier options, such as fast food or food high in sugar. 
                    This result in people in food desert have <strong> higher rate of obesity and heart disease.  </strong>due to a lack of <strong>nutritious food</strong> , people might deal with food insecurity. </p>

                    <h3>What causes food deserts?</h3>
                    <p>Many factors can create food deserts.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Poverty: </strong> If healthy food is expensive or income is too low, a household might be unable to afford it. This is why food deserts are very common in low-income areas. </li>
                            <li> <strong>Location: </strong>People in food deserts are far from grocery stores and supermarkets, which is why they occur in low-density rural or high-density urban areas.</li>
                            <li><strong>Racial policies: </strong>  food deserts in the U.S. are a product of policies that negatively affect communities of color. Policies, such as redlining, led to many communities of color experiencing poverty, and it has discouraged investment in healthier food options in these communities. </li>
                        </ul>

            <h2> What are the solutions to this problem?</h2>

                    <h3>Government intervention</h3>
                    <p>The government can create programs to help combat Food insecurity.  ,<strong>  <a href=""> 2020, about 55% of food-insecure households were in at least one of the three largest federal nutrition assistance programs</a></strong>:  <strong> SNAP, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program</strong> for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).<br>    
                    The correct implementation of government programs can help significantly reduce the problem.  The SNAP program alone has helped reduce the number of people suffering from food insecurity by 30%.

                    <h3>Supply chain consequences</h3>
                    <p>In recent news, we have seen huge back lines in the supply chain, including imported foodstuffs. Although the US does have a food surplus, it still imports 20% of the food that the populace eats. With a weaker economy, 
                        this has increased the number of people suffering from <strong>Food insecurity to 32% </strong>of those under the poverty line.
                        A change in supply chain management would better alleviate this problem, thereby boosting the economy. This means more money is invested into programs, and costs are lower.

                    <h3>Taxes</h3>
                    <p>Although nobody likes to pay taxes, they must pay for all sorts of things to help society. Without taxes, roads and bridges wouldn't be maintained, and these food programs wouldn't be funded. One possible solution, though to a lesser extent, is to create a ,<strong>small tax to fund these food programs </strong>specifically.</p>
